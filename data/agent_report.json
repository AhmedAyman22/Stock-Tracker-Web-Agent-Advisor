    "report": "Okay, I will analyze the recent performance of LLY (Eli Lilly), WMT (Walmart), and GOOGL (Alphabet/Google) based on a hypothetical 3-day period and provide a concise recommendation.\n\n**Report:**\n\nOver the past three days, LLY has shown a strong upward trend, indicating positive investor sentiment. WMT has remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations. GOOGL experienced a slight dip initially but recovered, ending near its starting price.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **LLY:** Given the sustained upward momentum, a **Hold** or cautious **Buy** might be considered, but watch for potential overbought signals.\n\n*   **WMT:** The stability suggests a **Hold** strategy. It's a reliable, but not high-growth, asset in the short term.\n\n*   **GOOGL:** The recovery after the dip warrants a **Hold**. Monitor for further upward movement as it regains its footing.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is a brief analysis based on limited hypothetical data. Consider consulting with a financial advisor and conducting thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n"
