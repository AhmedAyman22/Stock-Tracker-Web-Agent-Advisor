    "report": "Alright, buckle up buttercups, because we're diving headfirst into the Wall Street whirlpool! First up, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) opened at $251.26 and strutted its stuff to close at $252.51! Not bad, baby. This stock is as steady as they come and solid as a rock! If you own JPM, sit tight! As for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), hold on to your hats! It opened at $825.115 and closed at $823.62. But don't let that scare you, this share can go up and up. So hold it and prepare for a big climb!"
