    "report": "Listen up, buttercups! It looks like someone didn't get the memo on ticker symbols, 'cause BRK/A and BRK/B are playing hide-and-seek behind a \"404 page not found\" sign. Maybe they're off on a secret investor retreat, who knows?\n\nBut AVGO, oh, AVGO is strutting its stuff like a peacock in a parade!\nThis stock is playing hard to get. Opened at $203.9, dipped down to $201.08, teased us with a high of $205.68, and then closed at $203.64.\n\nIf you already own AVGO, hold tight, babe! But if you don't own any, hold off for now and see if the dip continues.\n"
